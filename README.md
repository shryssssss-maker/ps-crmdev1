## 🚨 Problem Statement

India has over **4,000 urban local bodies**, 28 state governments, and hundreds of civic departments — all operating **siloed grievance systems** with no interoperability.

| Pain Point | Reality |
|---|---|
| **No single window** | Citizens must know *which* portal to use for *which* issue |
| **Zero visibility** | Complaints disappear — no updates, no timelines |
| **Duplicate filings** | 50 citizens report the same pothole → 50 noise entries |
| **Language barrier** | Most portals require English, excluding 800M+ Hindi speakers |
| **No spatial intelligence** | Authorities can't see complaint clusters or hotspot zones |
| **Worker context gap** | Workers get vague assignments — no photos, no GPS, no SLA |
| **Jurisdictional overlap** | MCD, NDMC, DJB, PWD — complaints land in the wrong department |

> 📊 A **2023 CAG report** found that **34% of CPGRAMS complaints are closed without action.**

**The result:** chronic under-resolution, citizen frustration, and government departments that cannot measure their own performance.

## ✨ Why JanSamadhan is Different

| Feature | How It Works |
|---|---|
| 🗺️ **DIGIPIN Integration** | India's official 10-char location code (Dept of Posts). Every complaint gets a permanent, government-standard address — works even offline |
| 🤖 **Seva — Gemini AI Chatbot** | Citizens describe issues in Hindi or English via natural language. Gemini classifies category, severity, and auto-fills the form — no form literacy needed |
| 📍 **Movable Location Pin** | GPS auto-detects position; citizen can drag the map pin to correct it precisely. DIGIPIN re-encodes on every pin drop |
| 🗳️ **Community Severity Escalation** | Citizens upvote complaints. 10+ votes → +1 severity level. 50+ votes → force L4 Critical. Crowd intelligence replaces bureaucratic triage |
| 🔍 **PostGIS Duplicate Detection** | 20-metre radius check prevents spam *before* submission. Citizen is shown existing complaints and can upvote instead |
| 🏢 **Department-Scoped Authority Views** | Each authority only sees complaints from **their department**. Zero cross-department leakage — the #1 problem with CPGRAMS in India |
| 🔒 **ENUM State Machine in DB** | `complaint_status`, `severity_level`, `worker_availability` are PostgreSQL ENUMs. Invalid transitions are impossible even if someone bypasses the app |
| 🤖 **reCAPTCHA Protection** | Bot-spam prevention on complaint submission and login to prevent fake complaint flooding |
| 📋 **Immutable Audit Trail** | Every status change is logged to `ticket_history`. Citizens see public trail; authorities see internal notes. Tamper-proof |

## 🖥️ The 4 Major Portals

### Portal Access Credentials

| Role | Portal | Email | Password | Access Method |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 👤 **Citizen** | `/citizen` (Home) | *Login via Google* | — | Click "Sign in with Google" — auto-assigns Citizen role |
| 🏛️ **Authority** | `/authority` | `authority@gmail.com` | `Test1234!` | Email + Password login + Sign in with Google|
| 👷 **Worker** | `/worker` | `prakharwork@gmail.com` | `Test1234!` | Email + Password login + Sign in with Google|
| ⚙️ **Admin** | `/admin` | `hackathondb@gmail.com` | `Test1234!` | Email + Password login + Sign in with Google|

> **Note:** Citizens can also sign up manually by clicking "Sign Up", filling the form, and selecting the **Citizen** radio button to assign their role. Admin can invite new Authority and Worker accounts directly from the Admin Dashboard.

---

### Portal Descriptions

#### 👤 Citizen Portal
The public-facing Progressive Web App. Citizens can file complaints via the **Seva chatbot** (primary) or a manual form, track their ticket status in real-time, view complaints on an interactive map, upvote community issues, and rate resolved complaints.

#### 🏛️ Authority Dashboard
A department-scoped dashboard. Authorities only see complaints belonging to their assigned department. They can review tickets, add internal notes, escalate complaints, and assign work to available field workers — all filtered to prevent jurisdictional overlap.

#### 👷 Worker Dashboard
A mobile-optimised field interface. Workers see only their assigned complaints. They update status (in progress → resolved), upload proof photos, and navigate to job sites via Google Maps integration.

#### ⚙️ Admin Panel
Full platform control. Admins can view all complaints across all departments, manage the spatial map view, assign workers, invite new Authority/Worker accounts, view SLA breach reports, and generate AI-powered analytics summaries.

---

## 🛠️ Setup Guide

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** v18+
- **Python** 3.10+
- **Supabase** project (free tier works)
- **Google Gemini API key** (free tier — see note below)
- **Mappls Maps API key**
- **reCAPTCHA site key** (Google)

> ⚠️ **Gemini API Key is intentionally set to the FREE tier.** This is a deliberate design choice to prevent runaway costs during demos and to avoid billing spikes that could crash the AI service. The free tier is sufficient for hackathon-scale usage. See [API Reference](#-api-reference) for more details.

---

### Step 1 — Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/jansamadhan
cd jansamadhan
```

### Step 2 — Configure Environment Variables

Copy the example env file and fill in your credentials:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | Your Supabase project URL |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Public anon key for client-side calls |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | Server-side only — **never expose to client** |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Google Gemini API key (free tier) |
| `MAPPLS_API_KEY` | Mappls Maps API for India geocoding |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` | FastAPI backend URL (Railway or local) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY` | Google reCAPTCHA v2 site key |

### Step 3 — Database Setup

Run the SQL blocks in your Supabase SQL editor **in order**:

1. Create 3 ENUM types (`complaint_status`, `severity_level`, `worker_availability`)
2. Create all 8 tables in dependency order
3. Create spatial + performance indexes (GIST on geography column)
4. Create ticket ID sequence and `generate_ticket_id` trigger
5. Create all 8 trigger functions and attach them
6. Create all 9 RPC functions
7. Enable RLS and create all 28 policies
8. Seed 43 categories across 9 Delhi authority zones
9. Create `complaints-media` storage bucket from the Supabase Dashboard UI

### Step 4 — Install Dependencies

This project uses `pnpm` workspaces. Install all dependencies from the root directory:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Step 5 — Start the Frontend

```bash
cd apps/web
pnpm run dev
```

### Step 6 — Start the FastAPI Backend

```bash
cd apps/api
# Create a virtual environment first, or install globally
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## 🧭 Citizen Flow — Filing a Complaint

There are two ways a citizen can submit a complaint. The chatbot is the **primary, recommended path** — it's faster, smarter, and eliminates form-filling entirely.

### 💬 Seva Chatbot — Gemini AI (Primary Path)

**Seva** is JanSamadhan's AI-powered complaint assistant, built on **Google Gemini** (free tier). It transforms complaint filing from "fill a 10-field form" to "just tell me what happened."

#### What Seva Does

- Accepts free-text input in **Hindi or English**
- Uses Gemini's agentic reasoning to classify the complaint into one of **43 categories**
- Suggests the correct **severity level (L1–L4)** based on urgency language
- Identifies the **responsible authority** (e.g., "broken metro escalator" → DMRC)
- **Auto-fills the complaint form** — citizen just confirms and submits
- Conducts **multi-turn conversation** — asks clarifying questions if input is ambiguous
- Stores intent and session data in the `seva_queries` table for analytics

#### Example Conversation

```
Citizen:  "Hamare gali mein kachra 3 din se nahi utha — bohot badsbu aa rahi hai"

Seva:     "I've identified your issue:
           📋 Category   : Garbage Collection (MCD)
           🏢 Authority  : Municipal Corporation of Delhi
           ⚠️  Severity   : L3 — High (48-hour SLA)
           📍 Location   : Auto-detected from your GPS

           Shall I file this complaint at your current location?"

Citizen:  "Haan"

Seva:     "✅ Complaint filed. Your ticket number is DL-2026-00312.
           You can track it live on your dashboard."
```

> 🔑 **Why Gemini free tier?** The API key is deliberately configured on the free (non-billed) plan. This prevents any accidental billing spikes during the demo or public usage, which could cause service interruptions. The free quota is more than sufficient for demonstration scale.

---

### 📝 Manual Submission (Secondary Path)

For citizens who prefer the form approach, every field that Seva fills automatically is available manually:

1. Enter complaint title and description
2. Select a category from the 42+ category tree
3. Set severity level (L1 Low → L4 Critical)
4. Attach up to one photo (HEIC/JPEG/PNG, 5MB limit)
5. Confirm location on the map (see below)

---

### 📍 Location Pin & DIGIPIN

Location accuracy is critical for civic complaints. JanSamadhan solves this with a two-step location confirmation:

```
Step 1: GPS auto-detection
        ↓
        Map centres on your current coordinates

Step 2: Visual confirmation + drag-to-correct
        ↓
        You can drag the pin to the EXACT location
        (e.g., the specific pothole, not your home)

Step 3: DIGIPIN encoding
        ↓
        Final pin position → FastAPI /digipin/:lat/:lng
        → 10-character government-standard code
        → Stored permanently in complaints.digipin
```

#### What is DIGIPIN?

**DIGIPIN (Digital Postal Index Number)** is India's official location coding system developed by the **Department of Posts, Government of India**. It encodes any GPS coordinate into a **10-character alphanumeric code** that identifies a **4m × 4m area** anywhere in India.

```
Example:  28.6315°N, 77.2167°E  →  39J-948-H2PK
```

| Why DIGIPIN matters in JanSamadhan |
|---|
| Works in areas **without street names** — slums, villages, new colonies |
| **Works offline** — DIGIPIN is calculated from GPS, no internet needed |
| Field workers can navigate to a **4m × 4m square** — no address ambiguity |
| Survives **address renaming and subdivision** — permanent identifier |
| Enables **zone/ward-level aggregates** by DIGIPIN prefix for analytics |

---

### 🎫 How a Ticket is Generated

Once the location is confirmed and reCAPTCHA passes, the system runs a sequence of automatic operations:

```
1. PostGIS duplicate check (ST_DWithin 20m radius)
       ↓ No duplicate found
2. Complaint row inserted into database
       ↓ BEFORE INSERT trigger fires
3. Ticket ID generated: DL-{YEAR}-{SEQUENCE}
   e.g. DL-2026-00312
       ↓
4. SLA deadline set based on severity:
   L4 → 4 hours   | L3 → 48 hours
   L2 → 7 days    | L1 → 14 days
       ↓
5. Initial ticket_history row created (submitted)
       ↓
6. Citizen receives confirmation with ticket ID
```

The ticket ID sequence is guaranteed unique via a PostgreSQL `SEQUENCE` — no race conditions possible.

## 🏛️ Authority Flow — Department-Scoped, No Overlap

> **This solves one of India's biggest governance problems.**

In existing systems like CPGRAMS, MCD portal, and DJB portal — complaints from all departments are visible to everyone. An MCD officer can see DJB complaints. A PWD officer sees DMRC tickets. This causes confusion, misrouting, and no accountability.

**JanSamadhan enforces strict department isolation at the database level.**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A([🏛️ Authority logs in]) --> B[RLS Policy checks\nauth.jwt department claim]
    B --> C{Department assigned?}
    C -->|MCD Authority| D[Sees ONLY MCD complaints]
    C -->|DJB Authority| E[Sees ONLY DJB complaints]
    C -->|DMRC Authority| F[Sees ONLY DMRC complaints]
    C -->|PWD Authority| G[Sees ONLY PWD complaints]
    
    D --> H[Dashboard filtered view\nL4 Critical shown first]

    J -->|Assign to worker| K[Select available worker\nfrom same department]
    J -->|Add internal note| L[Note added with is_internal=true\nInvisible to citizen]
    J -->|Escalate| M[Manual escalation\nSeverity upgraded]
    J -->|Reject spam| N[Complaint marked rejected\nTerminal state]

    K --> O[assign_worker_to_complaint RPC\nFOR UPDATE row lock\nRace-condition safe]
    O --> P[Worker notified\nSLA clock starts ticking]
```

#### Why Department Isolation Matters

```
❌  WITHOUT JanSamadhan:
    Sewer overflow reported → lands in PWD dashboard →
    PWD says "not our problem" → DJB never sees it →
    Complaint dies

✅  WITH JanSamadhan:
    Sewer overflow reported → Seva/category maps to DJB →
    RLS ensures ONLY DJB authority can see and act on it →
    Clear ownership, clear accountability
```

**Row-Level Security (RLS)** enforces this at the PostgreSQL layer — not the frontend. Even if someone bypasses the app UI, the database will block cross-department access.

---

## 👷 Worker Flow

Workers operate from a **mobile-first PWA** designed for one-hand use in the field.

```mermaid

    A([👷 Worker opens app]) --> B[Toggle Availability: Available]
    B --> C[Authority assigns complaint\nvia assign_worker_to_complaint RPC]
    C --> D[📱 Complaint appears on worker dashboard]

    E --> F[🗺️ Tap Navigate\nOpens Google Maps with DIGIPIN coordinates]
    F --> G[Travel to site]
    
    G --> H[Update status: In Progress]
    H --> I[Work on the issue]
    
    I --> J{Issue resolved?}
    J -->|Yes| K[📸 Upload proof photo\nStored in complaints-media/resolution/]
    J -->|Needs escalation| L[Flag for authority\nStatus → escalated]
    
    K --> M[Update status: Resolved]
    M --> N[✅ DB trigger fires automatically:\n• Worker availability → available\n• current_complaint → NULL\n• resolved_at timestamp set]
    N --> O[Worker ready for next assignment]
    
    L --> P[Authority reviews escalation]
    P --> Q[Authority reassigns or adjusts severity]
    Q --> D
```

#### What Workers Can and Cannot See

| ✅ Worker CAN | ❌ Worker CANNOT |
|---|---|
| See their assigned complaints | See other workers' complaints |
| Update status for their complaints | Change complaint category or authority |
| Upload resolution proof photos | View internal authority notes |
| Navigate to complaint location | Assign themselves to other complaints |
| View their total resolved count | Access admin or authority dashboards |

---

## ⚙️ Admin Flow

Admin has **full access** across all departments and cities.

```
Admin Capabilities:
├── View ALL complaints (all departments, all statuses)
├── Spatial map view — see complaint clusters and hotspots
├── Assign workers to any complaint (atomic RPC with race-safety)
├── Invite new Authority and Worker accounts via email
│     └── Invitation carries metadata: role, department, city
│     └── on_auth_user_created trigger auto-creates profiles
├── View SLA breach dashboard — complaints past deadline
├── Trigger manual escalation
├── Access AI analytics summary (Gemini-generated weekly report)
└── Full audit trail — all 28 RLS policies still logged
```

---

## ⏱️ SLA & Escalation Engine

### SLA Deadlines by Severity

| Level | Deadline | Impact | Example Issues |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🟢 **L1 — Low** | 14 days | Minor inconvenience | Overgrown park, peeling paint |
| 🟡 **L2 — Medium** | 7 days | Moderate public impact | Pothole, broken streetlight |
| 🟠 **L3 — High** | 48 hours | Public disruption | Garbage pile, road blockage |
| 🔴 **L4 — Critical** | 4 hours | Emergency hazard | Sewage overflow, live wire |

### Community Severity Escalation

Citizens collectively upgrade complaint priority through upvotes:

| Upvotes Received | Severity Boost | Example (starts L2) | Example (starts L3) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 – 9 | No change | L2 stays L2 | L3 stays L3 |
| 10 – 24 | +1 level | L2 → L3 | L3 → L4 |
| 25 – 49 | +2 levels | L2 → L4 | L3 → L4 |
| 50+ | Force L4 Critical | L2 → L4 | L3 → L4 |

> Severity can **never go down** — `effective_severity` is always ≥ `severity`.  
> At **15+ upvotes**, the `possible_duplicate` flag is raised for admin review.

### Auto-Escalation on SLA Breach

A cron-callable RPC `check_sla_breaches()` runs periodically and automatically escalates complaints that have passed their SLA deadline:

```
complaint_status: assigned → escalated   (if SLA breached)
complaint_status: in_progress → escalated (if SLA breached)
```

Escalated complaints are surfaced at the top of the authority dashboard with a ⚠️ visual indicator.

### Complaint Lifecycle State Machine

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> submitted : Citizen files complaint
    submitted --> under_review : Admin/Authority reviews
    submitted --> rejected : Spam or invalid

    under_review --> assigned : Worker allocated
    under_review --> rejected : Duplicate or invalid
    under_review --> escalated : Manual escalation

    assigned --> in_progress : Worker starts work
    assigned --> escalated : SLA breached

    in_progress --> resolved : Work completed + proof photo
    in_progress --> escalated : SLA breached

    escalated --> under_review : Admin re-reviews

    resolved --> under_review : Citizen reopens (max 2 times\nwithin 72h window)
    rejected --> [*] : Terminal state
```

> The `enforce_status_transition()` trigger runs **BEFORE** every status `UPDATE` and raises a PostgreSQL exception for any invalid transition. This cannot be bypassed from the frontend.

| RPC | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `check_for_duplicate_report(lat, lng, category_id)` | PostGIS `ST_DWithin` 20m radius duplicate detection |
| `get_nearby_complaints(lat, lng, radius_m)` | Distance-ranked complaints within configurable radius |
| `increment_upvote_count(complaint_id)` | Atomic upvote + severity recalculation in single transaction |
| `assign_worker_to_complaint(complaint_id, worker_id)` | Race-safe worker assignment with `FOR UPDATE` row locks |
| `check_sla_breaches()` | Cron-callable: auto-escalates complaints past their SLA deadline |

### Gemini AI — Free Tier Configuration

> **Important:** The `GEMINI_API_KEY` in this project is configured to use Google's **free, non-billed tier**.
>
> **Why?** During hackathons and public demos, unbounded AI API calls can generate unexpected billing spikes — sometimes hundreds of dollars in minutes if the demo goes viral or a bot targets the endpoint. By using the free tier with its built-in rate limits, JanSamadhan ensures:
> - No accidental billing charges
> - Graceful degradation when quota is hit (falls back to manual form)
> - Safe for public demo deployment
>
> For production deployment at scale, upgrading to a billed Gemini key with usage caps is recommended.

## 🔐 Security Design

### reCAPTCHA
Google reCAPTCHA v2 is integrated on complaint submission to prevent automated bots from flooding the system with fake complaints. This is critical for a civic platform where complaint volume directly affects authority workload.

### Row-Level Security (28 Policies)
All 8 database tables have RLS enabled. Policies use `auth.uid()` and `auth.jwt()` — never recursive subqueries.

| Role | What They Can Access |
|---|---|
| **Citizen** | Own complaints (insert + read), public complaint listing, upvotes, ratings |
| **Worker** | Only their assigned complaints — cannot see others' |
| **Authority** | Only complaints from their assigned department |
| **Admin** | Full access across all tables |
| **service_role** | Bypass for server-side triggers and cron only |

### DIGIPIN Offline Capability
DIGIPIN encoding is a pure algorithm — no external API call required. Even in low-connectivity areas, complaint location can be accurately encoded and stored.

### ENUM State Machine
`complaint_status`, `severity_level`, and `worker_availability` are PostgreSQL ENUM types. Invalid values are rejected at the database level before any trigger or policy runs.
